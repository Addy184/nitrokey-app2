# Alternative Nitrokey Application - nitropy-app2

Work in Progress !!

## To run (Linux):
```
git clone https://github.com/nitrokey/nitropy-app2.git
cd nitropy-app2
make
source venv/bin/activate
python3.9 nitropyapp/gui.py
```
## Notes:
* the current version uses pynitrokey 
* therefore python 3.9 must first be installed
* the pynitrokey version in venv must also be replaced with (https://github.com/Nitrokey/pynitrokey/tree/nk3-updater)
